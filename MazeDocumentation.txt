To choose the size of the maze that is currently played, 
edit the two values for width and height of the maze
in the initMaze method(the first method in the 
MazeExamples class). Once the game is running use the arrow keys
to control the player square (the cyan square). The goal is to 
navigate the maze from the beginning (green square) to the end
(magenta square).If the player is moving on the correct path the
 animated search will present a blue trail, but if you waver from 
 the correct path then the incorrect step will display orange. 
 The incorrect steps are counted and the total number of wrong steps 
 is displayed upon winning the game.
 If the player reaches the end, the game will end and
a winning screen will be displayed. To display the correct path
before reaching the end, USE B FOR BFS, or D FOR DFS. 
To restart the game with another random maze
use r.
